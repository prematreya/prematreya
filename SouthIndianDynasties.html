			<p class="pandyan">They were one of the three earliest Tamil Dynasties &#40Chola, Chera and Pandyan&#41. The early Pandyan dynasty fell during the invasion of the rival Kalabhras. The dynasty came back during the early 5th century and then ruled the Tamil country. Their capital was a city named Madurai. They were in constant conflict with the Cholas and also conquered Sri Lanka and were masters at the sea and conquered the coast.</p>

			<p class="Chola"> The beginning of the Chola Empire is shrouded in mystery. The most famous king was Karikala Chola led the way for a golden age for the Cholas. The Kalabhras displaced them but when they were removed they came into a second golden age, refining the art of ship navigation becoming master of it. They eventually controlled the eastern coast of India.</p>
