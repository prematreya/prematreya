		<h2 class="History">History</h2>
			<p class="Hist">The Mughals are descended from the Turco Mongols, who are from central Asia. The first emperor, Babur, was ousted from his homeland and set his sights on India. He established a city called Kabul and invaded much of northern India, defeating a kingdom called the Delhi sultanate. Akbar, his grandson and the most famous emperor of this dynasty, conquered most of the empire. One other notable emperor was Shah Jahan, the man who built the Taj Mahal and nearly bankrupted the empire. Eventually a latter emperor named Aurangzeb gained control of most of south India but at his deathbed many parts of the empire were open revolt. This was the beginning of the end of the Mughal Empire.</p>
